Matlab code for analyzing domain wall fluctuations for PEEM images
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The code extracts domain wall of magnetic sample from an image sequence acquired
from X-ray photoemission electron microscopy. The code does the following
function described in the videos shown below;

1. Original image sequence after drift correction

2. Clearing unwanted area

3. Extracting domain wall from individual images from the sequence

The extracted DW image still requires pre processing of the images to obtain
perfect edges, here we are picking up the noises from the detector as well.

How to use the code:
Simply copy paste the code in the Matlab command window, edit as needed and run.
Description of the code, with example is available as pdf
