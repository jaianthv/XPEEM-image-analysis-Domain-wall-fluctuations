Matlab code for domain wall extraction from magnetic contrast images obtained from X-ray photoemission electron microscopy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code extracts the domain walls of magnetic domains from an image sequence acquired from X-ray photoemission electron microscopy. The code does the following function described in the videos shown below
1. Load XPEEM image sequence after drift correction<br>
