Matlab code for analyzing domain wall fluctuations for XPEEM image sequences
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Magnetic domains are subjected to thermal fluctuations, using this code enables to better understand and quantify such domain wall fluctuations

Codes written by Jaianth Vijayakumar

XPEEM experiment shown as an example is done by Jaianth Vijayakumar,
Carlos A.F. Vaz, Tatiana M. Savshenko, David Bracher

Samples prepared by Jaianth Vijayakumar, Micheal Horisberger

Supervisors for this project : Carlos A.F. Vaz and Frithjof Nolting

THE XPEEM IMAGES SHOWN HERE WERE MEASURED AT SIM BEAMLINE IN SWISS LIGHT SOURCE
PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUT, SWITZERLAND
